        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In representative democracies, citizens vote for representatives who are sent to create laws and administer the government on their
          behalf. In the United States, citizens elect representatives to three distinct levels of government: their local municipality,
          to their state government, and to the federal government.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the federal level, representatives are elected to the House of Representatives every two years. States are apportioned a number of
          representatives every ten years based on the results of the census. After the census, each state defines geographical regions called
          districts whose citizens will elect a single representative to the house. Defining localized districts allows the elected representative
          to cater towards the needs of the communities in the district who elected them.  
        </p>
        <p>
          The laws for who is responsible for drawing and approving districts varies by state, however generally the legislature of a state is
          given the responsibility of drawing districts. Voting populations tend to not be geographically homogenous, for example densely populated
          cities tend to vote for Democrats while more sparsely populated regions tend to vote more Republican. As a result, the boundaries of a
          district can have an effect on the likelihood of certain candidates being elected. This gives an incentive to a states legislature, which
          may be controlled by a particular party at the time that the districts are redrawn, to choose districts that benefit the party in power.
          Try the interactive diagram below to see how the chosen districts effect the results of the representatives chosen.

        <p>
          The diagram above cuts the space into equally sized districts, however the population of each district varies. The Supreme Court
          ruled in 1964 that unequally populated districts violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since the vote
          of an individual in one district has different weight than the vote of an individual in another. For legislatures who are choosing
          districts however, this just adds a constraint on which possible districts it can choose, it does not fix the issue of Gerrymandering.
        </p>
        <h3>Gerrymandering Methods</h3>
        <p>
          There are two primary methods legislatures can use to construct Gerrymandered districts: cracking and packing. Both methods rely
          on the idea that one can use census statistics or previous election results to get an idea of how voters are distributed. Using this
          distribution, the boundaries can be chosen to partition nearby voters into different districts. The core issue is that any votes over
          the threshold needed to win (50%) or that cannot add up to the needed threshold are effectively wasted, since they are not going
          towards changing the candidate that is chosen. Explore the two diagrams below comparing the methods.

        <p>
          The idea behind cracking is to 'crack' a group of voters who vote similarly, say because they live in a large city, between different
          districts. This causes a group of voters with similar interests to be unable to attempt to elect the same individual. Packing on the
          other hand groups voters who vote similarly into one or a small number of districts, leaving the surrounding districts to contain a
          different voting population.

        <h3>North Carolina 2012 Elections</h3>
        <p>
          Republicans won majorities in both houses of the North Carolina legislature in the 2010 election which coincided with the redistricting
          process which needed to occur after the 2010 census. The proposed districts were used in both the 2012 and 2014 elections before being
          invalidated by the North Carolina Supreme Court on the grounds that the districts violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Below is a map
          of North Carolina showing the results of the 2012 House of Representatives elections. You can zoom in and pan around the map, in particular
          take a look at District 1, District 4, and District 12. Can you tell which methods were used to construct these districts?
